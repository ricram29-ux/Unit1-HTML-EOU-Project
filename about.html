        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>I'm a freshman at Bergen County Techincal Schools in Teterboro, enrolled in the Computer Science program. I chose this program because ever since I was a little kid, I have always had an interest for coding. I went to many MakerSpace camps over the summer, as I wanted to get a deeper understanding about coding. I love coding and creating things that others can use in their daily life.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I like to play Video Games, like Roblox, and play a lot of soccer. I also like to 3D print a lot of things using my computer. I'm excited to develop my skills throughout high school and pursue a career in technology.</p>
