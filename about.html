      <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a freshman at Bergen County Technical Schools in Teterboro, enrolled in the Computer Science program.
        I chose this program because ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always had an interest in coding. I attended
        many MakerSpace camps over the summer to deepen my understanding of programming. I love coding and creating
        things that others can use in their daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school, I like to play video games (like Roblox) and soccer. I also enjoy 3D printing objects using
        my computer. I'm excited to develop my skills throughout high school and pursue a career in technology.
      </p>
