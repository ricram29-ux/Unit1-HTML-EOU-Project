        <p>Being healthy and staying active is very important. I have played soccer my entire life. I recently started playing for a team on basketball also. On soccer, I am a team captain, and it has helped me to learn responsibilty, teamwork, and accountability. I believe that people should take responsibility and accountability for their mistakes, and their teammates should make it known to them.</p>
